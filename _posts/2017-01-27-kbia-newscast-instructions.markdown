# Goal of Newscasts
Present the top news stories of the day from the listening area, and those statewide that have local interest.  Each newscast will be a compilation of staff and student wraps and readers, stories from Jefferson City legislative reporters, and stories from other Missouri Public Radio stations.

We want to focus on hard-news and essential stories.  In such a short amount of time, there isn’t the chance for features or “evergreen” pieces.  We want to catch people on their commute and provide them with exactly what they need to know about the day. Try to follow the Five Tiers of News Coverage if you can.

# Script Format
1.  There are templates made for each newscast, they go like this:
Intro:  From the KBIA newsroom in Columbia, I’m (name)
Outro:  I’m (name), KBIA news, Columbia
2.  The Slug for your script is the three letter month, two digit date, then a notation of which newscast the script is for. 
    - Example: The first morning newscast on January 23rd would be JAN23AM1. The second one would be JAN23AM2.
3.  Save script in “PM NEWSCAST” > “SCRIPTS” > “(Month)” > (DAY)
    - Make sure you create a new day subfolder for each anchor shift and save everything there, or else the files will overwrite old files that we need to keep for archive purposes.

## Writing tips: 
-   Bury the word “yesterday” in at least the second sentence
-   Always lead the cast with hard news
-   It’s okay to repeat stories between casts, but space them out
-   If there’s a huge story, definitely repeat it

## Sound Bites
1.  You need a cut line for each sound bite, not the transcription
2.  Cut line includes slug, TRT and OC or SOC (standard out cue, for a wrap)
    - __Example…CASINO0302      TRT :15 OC:  lots of money__
3.  Make sure to __bold and underline__ cut line.

# Sending Sound to Audiovault
1.  Open “My Computer”
2.  Click on “N Drive”
3.  Find sound bite, make sure its title is no more than 13 characters
    - No spaces, no special characters
    - All sound files MUST be in Windows PCM .wav format
4.  Single click sound bite
5.  Click “Copy this file” (on left side of screen)
6.  Select “V Drive” and open the “NWS” folder
7.  Click “Copy”
8.  Repeat until “Overwrite” message appears, then hit “OK”

# Sample PM Newscast Script
JAN23AM1

From the KBIA newsroom in Columbia, I’m (name)

Missouri has wrapped up its tax-free holiday weekend on back-to-school merchandise, which included clothing, pencils, paper, and computers.  Department of Revenue officials say it’s hard to measure how much revenue the state loses each year during the 3-day event.  But so far, it’s not enough to spark any movement to kill it.  Revenue spokesperson Ted Farnen (FAR-nen) says the tax holiday remains popular with shoppers:

<u><strong>SalesT2 ------------- TRT 0:16 ----------- OC: most states</strong></u>

“At least a couple (of) other states, including our neighbor to the east, Illinois, just instituted a new sales tax holiday, very similar to ours, even though the budget situation has been very challenging for Illinois, as it has for most states.”

The head of the Missouri Retailers Association says the holiday also drives up purchases of other items that are not exempt from the state sales tax during the holiday.  

Missouri House member Brian Nieves (nee-EH'-vehs) has been accused of threatening an aide to a Republican opponent in last week's state Senate primary. Twenty-four-year-old Shawn Bell made the allegations in a report he filed with police in the eastern Missouri town of Washington. Nieves did not immediately return calls seeking comment today. He beat Bell's boss, Dick Stratman, and two other Republicans in the Aug. 3 Senate primary. In his statement to police, Bell says he stopped by Nieves' campaign after the election to offer congratulations. Bell claims Nieves shouted, slapped him several times, drew a gun from his pocket and said he would kill him. Bell says Nieves later calmed down and said he wouldn't kill him or put him in the hospital.
