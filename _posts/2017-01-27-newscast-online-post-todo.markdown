# Gather All Your Newscast Stories into One MP3 file
Use Audition and the broadcast logs to cut one long newscast that contains every story you covered once, then export it as an MP3 file so you can upload it to Core Publisher.

# Find or Post All Your Newscast Stories on KBIA's Web Site
If the stories are from St. Louis Public Radio or KCUR, they should already be on KBIA's web site automatically. The easiest way to find these is use Google to search `[the story's headline or several keywords here] site:kbia.org` -- this will return all the stories from the KBIA web site that match those keywords. Once you've found the story, keep it open in a separate tab; you'll need the link later.

It's a good idea to try this same process with AP or KBIA stories first as well, but if nothing shows up, you'll need to [post them yourself](http://apps.kbia.org/workingatkbia/2017/video-creating-core-publisher-post/). For AP stories, be sure to [include a Creative Commons image](http://apps.kbia.org/workingatkbia/2017/video-adding-images-online-story/).

Important note: At the bottom of the new post window in Core Publisher, you'll see an area that asks you if you want to send your story to the NPR API, NPR One or the PMP. __Do not send your AP stories through any of these.__

# Create a Master Newscast Post with Links to All the Other Stories and Your Recording
Now, make a new post in Core Publisher under the category "news" for your newscast. Leave yourself as the author and follow the template below to make your post. 

At the bottom of the screen, where it asks if you want to send the program through the NPR API, NPR One or the PMP, say yes. 

__In the NPR One expiration area, tell morning newscasts to expire on the same day they are posted at 1:00 p.m. and afternoon newscasts to expire the same day they were posted at 11:59 p.m. If you don't do this right, there will be trouble!!__
