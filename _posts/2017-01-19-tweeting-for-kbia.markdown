Use these guidelines to keep your tweets for KBIA clean and professional.

## 1. Follow the same rules of journalism you would any other time.
Make sure you are properly sourcing your information, checking your facts and using good spelling and AP style. An error on Twitter is just as unprofessional as an error in an article or radio story.

## 2. If calling out KBIA at the end of your tweet, don't just leave it hanging there.
If an instructor or coworker has asked you to make sure your tweets are marked as for KBIA, don't just put "@kbia" a the end. Take the extra characters to say "(for @KBIA)" instead. For example:
<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jesse Hall is PACKED for the final screening of &quot;Sonita.&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrueFalse?src=hash">#TrueFalse</a> (for <a href="https://twitter.com/KBIA">@KBIA</a>) <a href="https://t.co/c5pC0sQ4ox">pic.twitter.com/c5pC0sQ4ox</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Levi (@ryan_levi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan_levi/status/706544795376680961">March 6, 2016</a></blockquote>

## 3. Prefer quote tweets to vanilla retweets.
To make sure it doesn't look like you're endorsing one person in your story over another, make sure you are using quote tweets when retweeting them. This also gives you a great opportunity to add a little context and analysis, which should never hurt.

## 4. Keep it professional.
Don't swear when you're using Twitter to report for KBIA, and don't report for KBIA on a Twitter account where you're also voicing strong political views. Your behavior online is a reflection of KBIA whether you're on the clock or not, so make sure it's good.
