As a student at KBIA, you'll be required to follow certain guidelines and policies regarding equipment. 

## Things You'll Need to Get Yourself
- **SD Cards** - without these you will not be able to record audio.
- **AA Batteries** - if you'll be recording with a Marantz, this will be required, since batteries frequently run out, and KBIA does not replace the batteries in student gear.
- **Press ID cards** - As a KBIA reporter, you can purchase a photo press pass from the University Bookstore.  This is not required, but if you would like to progress to advanced radio reporting, it’s a good idea, and you can wear the pass during your shifts and any time you report in the field.

## Things You Can Check Out from the Radio-TV Equipment Lab
The Radio-TV Equipment Lab on the second floor of Gannett hall has the following available for checkout by journalism students:

- **Marantz PMD-661 Field Recorder Kit** - a high quality audio field recorder and microphone kit, similar to what is used by the folks at This American Life and NPR nationally.
- **iPad Mini and iRig Kit** - a high quality audio preamp and microphone that connect into the (provided) iPad mini.

<strong>Troubleshooting Your Equipment: </strong>
If you encounter a problem with a Marantz or iPad, fill out a trouble report at the equipment lab. If you think any problems may have been “operator error,” bring the Marantz to the newsroom and a tiger chair or editor will talk you through the process to troubleshoot the problem.

<strong>Requesting Extensions on Equipment Loans: </strong>
If you need a Marantz for longer than the time allowed for equipment rental, email the newsroom at news@kbia.org requesting an extension and specifying the timeframe, and the tiger chair/editors on deck, will forward your request to the TAs, and copy you.</div>

Consult the B1/B2 syllabus and visit the lab to learn about lab hours and policies – KBIA equipment rentals are included in these policies.
