<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Always check your equipment before leaving the studio.</strong> If you don't, you might just find yourself trying to conduct an interview with dead batteries or a broken recorder. Record something and play it back to make sure everything is working as it should, and you'll prevent an unpleasant surprise later.</div>

As you get ready to gather audio for your story in the field, keep these tips in mind.

## 1. Keep your microphone as close to the subject as possible.
Ideal mic placement is roughly six inches away and slightly to the side so that you avoid popping “p” sounds. Go in closer if the interviewee speaks softly, and try not to keep turning up the mic. If you find yourself adjusting levels regularly, it's probably because of your mic placement.

## 2. Choose a quiet spot.
Avoid hallways, rooms with high ceilings like gymnasiums or cafeterias, stay away from air conditioners or fans and be careful of music playing in the background.

## 3. Gather 30 seconds to one minute of ambient noise.
Gathering a chunk of silence in the room where you conduct your interview (often referred to as 'ambient sound' or just as 'ambi') will give you lots more options for editing and correction later in the process.

## 4. Keep quiet...avoid your own vocal affirmations or tics while listening.
As difficult as it is, resist the temptation to add your own "Uh huh" or "OK" in between your interviewee's comments. This practice, often referred to as "stepping on the subject" will ruin some of your best quotes and make the interviewee feel rushed. We do this in regular conversation to show we're listening, but the best way to show you're listening as a journalist is to direct your attention to the interviewee and ask intelligent, informed questions.

## 5. Keep still...beware of mic handling noise and cord rustling.

## 6. You should always be the one holding the mic, **not** the interviewee.
No matter how easy it may seem or how much you're convinced the interviewee would be more comfortable if they were just holding the mic themselves, resist the temptation to hand it over. 

## 7. Wear headphones.
The only way to know if the audio you're gathering is any good or not is to hear it yourself as it's being captured.

## 8. Ask people to self-ID.
Get them saying their name and title and spelling these things **on tape** so you always have something you can go back to in case of confusion.

## 9. Watch your levels.

## 10. Record as **.wav** files.

## 11. Mark the times of good audio.
